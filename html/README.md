README File for EpicAdmin Project
=================================
12/29/2014

This repository is for the Epic Admin website.

It contains all the code for getting the website to run, including: php, html,
javascript, and sql.   In addition it contains various documentation files.

The code is written to be run under apache.  However, it was developed on
a windows machine running IIS.  It uses MySql for the database.  To run on
your machine, you will need a webserver that supports PHP 5  and a MySql database.

To install:
1. Insure that you have a webserver that supports PHP 5 and a MySql database running on your machine.
2. Download all files and place them in your html directory. 
3. Create writable directories for uploads and logs.
4. Run the SQL scripts, once, to create the database and it's tables.
5. Edit config.php to suit your setup.

Tools used to develop:
1. Putty -- for telnet to actual website, and issues console commands
2. Notepad++ -- for text editing.
3. FileZilla -- for transferring the files to the actual website
4. MySql Workbench -- for editing the database
5. TortoiseHg -- for source control
6. IIS -- to host a local copy of the website
7. Chrome,IE,Safia -- Browsers, of course.

Good Luck
