The Event Table is the list of meetings that the team
holds during the year.  Attendance is scored against
this table.  There is only one table, and it can be 
changed (uploaded) any time without hurting the raw
attendance data.  Uploading a new table causes the
attendance scores to be recalculated.

The columns in the table are:

Name, StartTime, EndTime, Type, Purpose

Name is used to lable the attendance records for that
event.  Typically, it is a simple abbrivation of the
date, such as "1/3".  

StartTime and EndTime specifiy the time of the event. 
Normally they should be on the same day.  Regular SQL 
time format is expected, such as "2015-01-03 18:30:00" 
-- where the year, month, date, hour, minute, and second
is given in 24-hour format.  To get credit for attending
an event, a member must scan in or out during these times,
or be scanned in throughout the event.

Type tells if the event is counted toward the attendance 
requirement.  It can be one of "Regular", "Manditory", or
"Optional".  

Purpose is a comment about the event that might be displayed
with other data.  It should be kept short (say 20 chars max).


Instructions:

To upload the table, create a csv file with the columns
described above.  The names of the columns must match thoses
above exactly.  Its okay to have more columns than those
listed -- they will be ignored.  

Once the csv file is complete, upload it.  It will replace
any existing event table.
