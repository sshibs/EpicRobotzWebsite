How to Import Pictures in Bulk

1. Upload the pictures to some public place on the internet,
such as a public folder in dropbox. Make sure you can see each picture
by typing an url into a browser.

2. Prepare a CSV file that has the following column headers:
   -- UserName
   -- Picture

3. Note, the headers labels must be spelled exactly as shown above. 
Its okay to have extra columns, but these two must be present.

4. The CSV file can be created as an Excel worksheet, and then
saved as a CSV file.

5. Under the UserName column, put the username with the exact
spelling and case.

6. Under the picture column put the full url that locates the 
picture on the web.

7. Upload the csv file using this page.

8. The import will probably take a long time.  The website will
timeout after 2 minutes. Use mulitple files if this is a problem.
Usually, one picture can be processed in about two second.

9. Results of this operation will be written to the system log.
