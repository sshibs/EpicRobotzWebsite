Microsoft Word File Template Set-up Instructions

Step 1
• Download the template you've chosen in your computer format. The templates have been compressed as .zip file. Double click on the downloaded file to unzip it and view the templates.

Step 2
• Open the .docx file in Microsoft Word. If there is a back and a front, create a separate document for each side, or use the provided front and back files. The files will already be the appropriate finish size, and will include crop marks, guides, live areas, and fold marks for you to follow.

Step 3• Customize the template, adding your own design and information on top of the template. Pay close attention to the guides and live areas designated, so that your information will not get cut off the page. If you wish to add photos, go to the Insert dropdown, choose Photo, and Picture From File. Choose your photo and be sure that your images are at least 300 dpi.

Step 4• Save your file. Be sure to delete the layer/image that includes the instructions and guides, or it will print with your file.Notes:• To print to the paper's edge make sure that your image extends to the green boundary box.• Your text should not extend beyond the red safety area on all sides.• You must remove the instruction layer or it will be printed.
