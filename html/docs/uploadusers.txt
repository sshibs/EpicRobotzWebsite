1. Prepare a CSV file that has the following column headers:
   -- UserName
   -- Password
   -- LastName
   -- FirstName
   -- NickName
   -- Title
   -- Email
   -- Tags
   -- Active
   -- Picture
   -- BadgeID

3. The CSV file can be created as an Excel worksheet, and then
saved as a CSV file.

data as appropriate.  The data under "Picture" is an url that
points to a picture on the web of the user.

5. Upload the file using this page.

user will be added.
