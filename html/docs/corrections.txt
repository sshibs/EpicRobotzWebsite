Instructions for Corrections

A correction file can be uploaded to insert corrections
into the reader data.  Each time this file is uploaded,
it replaces all corrections from the past.

The correction file is a csv file, with the following columns:

Action, BadgeID, T0, Comment

The first line of the file must have the above column headers,
spelled exactly as shown. There can be more columns and the 
columns can be out-of-order, but this line must be present.

The columns are formatted as follows:

  Action   -- The command, explained below.
  BadgeID  -- The badge ID that this column pretains to.  Star ("*")
              in this column means all badges.
  T0       -- A time value in the format "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"
  Reason   -- A comment string, explaining why the correction is needed.
              Cannot contain commas, unless entire comment is in quotes.
  
The action column can be one of the following:

  "DeleteScan"   -- Delete all scans on the day which contains T0
  "AddScanIn"    -- Adds a scan-in, at T0.
  "AddScanOut"   -- Adds a scan-out, at T0.

Note, the corrections are processed and applied in order, after the raw
scans from the readers are loaded.  

An example file might look like:
